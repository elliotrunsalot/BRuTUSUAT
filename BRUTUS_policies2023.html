            <p>BRuTUS & The Knife - For those that miss out on an entry, a waitlist will be established. The price of
                your entry will be determined by the date you were added to the waitlist.
                For example, if you registered in August during the early entry period, but
                you were not offered an entry until November, you would still pay the early entry
                price.</p>

            <p>If you cannot participate in the event for any reason, entry fee refunds are
                available in accordance with the below-stated withdrawal dates only. After
                the stipulated dates, entry fees are non-refundable for withdrawals initiated
                by the athlete. Requests for refunds must be emailed to the organiser via

            <p>Withdrawal Refunds</p>
        </div>

            <p>Where eligible, please allow up to 30 business days for your refund to be
                processed. The refund is automatically issued to the credit card originally
                used to pay for the registration. If this card has since been cancelled or has
                expired it is the athlete’s responsibility to notify us when requesting the
                eligible refund.
