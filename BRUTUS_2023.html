	        <h2>The Event</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the the knife-like elevation profile of Mt. Coree, the stunning views over the Cotter, and an unrelated coup d'etat that happened in 44BCE, the BRuTUS 60km is an exciting new event on the ACT trail running calendar. 
            <p>ULTRA Mediocre Runners of Canberra Incorporated welcomes you to enjoy this premier October ultra distance trail race, which, though challenging, probably will not bear any particular semblance to an historical event in which a tyrant's senators, including his closest ally, stabbed him 23 times. 
            <p>Please join us on this occasion, which, though an exciting opportunity for runners who wish to push beyond 50kms or grab a last-ditch qualifier for next year's 6-foot track, will not necessarily be the kind of thing Shakespeare would have written a play about.</p>
          
            <h2>The Races</h2>
    
            <div class="eventinfo">

                    <h3>The BRuTUS</h3>
                    <p>The BRuTUS is a 60km course starting at the historic Blue Range Hut. 
                        It follows One Stick Road, then East West Road before crossing Brindabella Road and continuing into the Cotter Catchment Area.
                        Runners will pass (but not cross) Vanitys Crossing before reaching CP1.
                        After CP1 Runners can expect some ot the smaller hills before reaching CP2 at Curries Road where they will make the second crossing of Brindabella Road.
                        The major climb of the course is already visible at this point and runners will take Pabral Road into NSW, then Coree Summit Road to the top.
                        After summiting runners return down the summit road to Coree Campground and CP3.
                        What folloes is a long and challenging section on Two Sticks Road, followed by Blue Range Road.
                        Runners breifly return to ACT where they will reach CP4 before proceeding back ober the boarder along Ganges Trail.
                        Off Ganges Trail lies the final obstacle, a sharp rutted descent to Radiata Trail. 
                        Heading South on Dead Horse Gate Road, those who have run the GUMBY will find themselves in familiar territory. 
                        A Gentle descent brings runners in to the finish line at Blue Range Hut.

                    <h3>The Knife</h3>
                    <p>Taking in 15km of dirt track with 600m of accumulated elevation pain, the Knife is a mediocre serve of wild radiata pine forest and blackberry. 
                        Runners will head west on Blue Range Road before making a turn for the worst at Poo Bear Corner. 
                        The course screws then pinches on a sharp left with no mercy. 
                        At the top of the climb there is a marshall to offer you a grim look of sympathy. 
                        Here the Knife joins the BRuTUS course along the Ganges Trail for a descent which is more technical than you were expecting.
                        At least you can be comforted by the fact that everyone who signed up for the BRuTUS will encounter with 50kms in their legs.
                        Eventually the trail flattens out and the route ahead looks like an easy run.
                        But that's not where you're going. 
                        Good luck.
