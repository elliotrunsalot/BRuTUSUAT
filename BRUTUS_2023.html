	        <h2>The Event</h2>
            <p>Inspired by the knife-like elevation profile of Mt. Coree, the stunning views over the Cotter, and an unrelated coup d'etat that happened in 44BCE, the BRuTUS 60km is an exciting new event on the ACT trail running calendar. 
            <p>ULTRA Mediocre Runners of Canberra Incorporated welcomes you to enjoy this premier October ultra-distance trail race, which, though challenging, probably will not bear any particular semblance to an historical event in which a tyrant's senators, including his closest ally, stabbed him 23 times. 
            <p>There are two opportunities for runners to either push beyond 50kms, or power through a sharp 15km: courses that, dramatic as they are, will not necessarily be the kind of thing Shakespeare would have written a play about. </p>
          
            <h2>The Races</h2>
    
            <div class="eventcontainer">
        
                <div class="textbox1">
        
                    <h3>The BRuTUS 60km/2000m elev.</h3>
                    <p>The BRuTUS is a 60km course starting at the historic Blue Range Hut. 
                        It follows One Stick Road, then East West Road before crossing Brindabella Road and continuing into the Cotter Catchment Area.
                        Runners will pass (but not cross) Vanitys Crossing before reaching CP1.
                        After CP1 runners can expect some of the smaller hills before reaching CP2 at Curries Road where they will make the second crossing of Brindabella Road.
                        The major climb of the course is already visible at this point and runners will take Pabral Road into NSW, then Coree Summit Road to the top.
                        After summiting runners return down the Summit Road to Coree Campground and CP3.
                        What follows is a long and challenging section on Two Sticks Road, followed by Blue Range Road.
                        Runners briefly return to ACT where they will reach CP4 before proceeding back over the boarder along Ganges Trail.
                        Off Ganges Trail lies the final obstacle, a sharp rutted Slippery Dip to Radiata Trail. 
                        Heading South on Dead Horse Gate Road, those who have run the GUMBY will find themselves in familiar territory. 
                        A gentle descent brings runners to the finish line at Blue Range Hut.

                <div class="textbox2">
                    <h3>The Knife 14km/680m elev.</h3>
                    <p>Taking in 14km of dirt track with 680m of accumulated elevation pain, the Knife is a mediocre serve of wild radiata pine forest and blackberry. 
                        Runners will head west on Blue Range Road before making a turn for the worst at Poo Bear Corner. 
                        The course screws then pinches on a sharp left leading to a climb known as the Lung Piercer. 
                        At the top ot the Lung Piercer runners rejoin Blue Range Road and continue to climb to the sole aid station where a marshall will grimly direct them down the Ganges Trail. 
                        Here the Knife joins the BRuTUS course for a descent more technical than most runners are prepared for, but it's the last see.
                        At least they can be comforted by the fact that everyone who signed up for the BRuTUS will encounter this with 50kms in their legs.
                        Eventually the trail flattens out and the route ahead looks like an easy run.
                        But that's not where you're going. 
                        Good luck.
