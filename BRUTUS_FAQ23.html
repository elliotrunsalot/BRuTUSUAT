    <h2>GUMBY T-Shirts.</h2>
    
    <p>As part of the inaugural GUMBY we’re offering entrants the opportunity to purchase a once-off GUMBY running tee at cost price for just $45. You’ve seen the sweet, sweet shirts those ULTRA Mediocre guys get around in and had the thought, “I don’t know what that is but I want one!” Entering the GUMBY or GUMBaby gives you the opportunity to order a sweet shirt of your very own, with a GUMBY twist.</p>
    <p>These Champion System shirts are perfect for running long and perfecter for running longerer. Your GUMBY memorabilia t-shirt will get noticed whether on the road or the trail. It’ll be the ultimate conversation starter at a party or on casual Friday at the office. Impress your boss, friends, colleagues and strangers with your stories of how you were there, you ran the laps, you showed your teeth and your grit in a race that was so tough only one person finished.</p>

<div class="faq">
    
    <div class="question">
        <p>Should I sign up for the BRuTUS, or The Knife?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The BRuTUS. The Knife sounds hard. Seriously. There's a climb in it they call the "Lung Piercer".</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Is there mandatory gear?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. The athlete's guide will be emailed to you with specifics prior to race day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Is there mobile or internet coverage?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Blue Range Hut sits in a valley and mobile reception and internet are patchy at best. Reception is typically better on higher points along the course.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I be supported by a crew?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>For the BRuTUS, yes. All check points are accessible along dirt roads, and it is possible for crew to meet runners at most places on the course. Driving on the course is discouraged for the safety of runners. 
            Please do not attempt to meet your runner after check point 4. The Ganges Trail in narrow and not maintained to the level of other fire trail in the area.
        </p>
        <p>It is the organisers view that crewing for The Knife is unnecessary, however spectating is highly encouraged on the Lung Piercer and the Slippery Dip. No Vehicle access to the Slippery Dip.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>I want to camp at the hut. How do I book my campsite?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Bookings can be made during the entry process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are cooking facilities available at the Hut?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Yes. There is a permanent gas BBQ on site.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Will there be food and water available?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>We will have water, sports drink and some refreshments available at each of the checkpoints.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>If I camp, can I have a campfire?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Fires are permitted only in the designated fire pits. You are not permitted to collect firewood in the nature reserve. We will have firewood available for the main fire around the hut, but if you want to use one of the other fire pits we suggest you bring some wood with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Where can I park?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>While it is possible to park inside the locked gate, you should plan to park outside the gate along the side of the access road. People should only request to park inside the gate if the car will be parked there until the BRUTuS is over. Spaces are very limited and the gate will be locked before the start of the race.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I bring my caravan?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>No. Blue Range Hut is set up for tent camping only. Space is limited so please don’t pitch a tent that is a house.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I bring my dog(s)?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Although dogs are technically permitted at Blue Range Hut, we ask that you do not bring your dog on race day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Can I dispose of rubbish at the Hut?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>Please take all your rubbish with you and pick up any litter around your campsite when you pack up. We have to ensure that the entire area is rubbish free when we leave.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are there toilets on the course?</p>
    </div>    
    <div class="answer">
        <p>There are toilets at Blue Range Hut (Start/Finish) and at the Coree Campsite (CP3).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="question">
        <p>Are showers available?</p>

    </div>
